This repository contains my projects that were implemented as part of the Advanced topics in recommendation systems course at Ben Gurion University of The Negev.  </br>
During the course I have implemented 3 projects - SVD model, Visually-Aware recommendation system and CTR prediction models.

---

The porjects were implemented in python 3.7, using pycharm and Google Colab. 

---

## Projects
1. SVD model implementaion - implement a recommendation system based on Matrix Factorization.

2. CTR prediction - a kaggle competition on Taboola data. The task was to build a model that predicts if a user will click on an item.

3. Visually-Aware recommendation system - separate repository
